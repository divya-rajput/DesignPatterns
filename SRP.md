# Single responsiblity principle
There should be a proper Segregation of responsiblities in every level of programming(Module, Interfaces, Classes, Functions, Methods, Objects). This principle helps us to build a code with is more understandable and has good unit testing and maintainability qualities. This is one step towards achieving proper pragramming paradigm.

# How SRP can be achieved?
SRP can be achieved by many ways like properly naming Module, Interfaces, Classes, Functions, Methods and Objects.
Here based on the roles the responsiblity should be divided. Example: There should be a different class of a Manager(), TeamLead() and, an Employee(). Since, there Roles are different although being a part in same organization.Similarly, Module, Interfaces, Functions, Methods and Objects should be seperated based on the responsiblity.

# What happens when SRP is violated?
If SRP is not followed in the code, one will end up in writing complex code which is hard to understand by any other.
