# Single responsiblity principle
There should be a proper Segregation of responsiblities in every level of programming(Module, Interfaces, Classes, Functions, Methods, Objects). This principle helps us to build a code with is more understandable, has good unit testing, and  maintainability qualities. This is one step towards achieving proper programming paradigm.

# How SRP can be achieved?
SRP can be achieved by various ways like proper naming conventions used for Module, Interfaces, Classes, Functions, Methods and Objects.
Here, based on the roles the responsiblity should be divided. Example: There should be a different class of a Manager(), TeamLead() and, an Employee(). Since, their Roles are different although being a part of same organization.Similarly, Module, Interfaces, Functions, Methods and Objects should be seperated based on the their responsiblities. In UI based applications SRP can be achieved by using various models like MVC(Model View Controller) and MVVM (Model View-View Model).

# What happens when SRP is violated?
If SRP is not followed in the code, one will end up in writing complex code which is hard to understand by anyone else.
