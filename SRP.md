# Single responsiblity principle
There should be a proper seggregation of responsiblities in ever level of programming(Module, Interfaces, Classes, Functions, Methods, Objects). This principle helps us to build a code with is more understandable and has good unit testing and maintainability qualities.

# How SRP can be achieved?
SRP can be achieved by many ways like properly naming Module, Interfaces, Classes, Functions, Methods and Objects.
Here based on the roles the responsiblity should be divided. Example: There should be a different class of a Manager(), TeamLead() and, an Employee(). Since, there Roles are different alothough being a part in same organization.
