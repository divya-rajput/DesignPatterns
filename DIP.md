# Dependency Inversion Principle
## Definition
* High level module(Closer to the customer) should not be dependent lower level module(closer to the data storage).
* Both should depend on the abstraction
* So, We end up having 2 dependencies. High level module on abstraction and lower level on the same abstraction.
