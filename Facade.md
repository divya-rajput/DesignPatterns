# Facade Design Pattern
## Definition
* It is a structural design pattern. The complex system is divided into multiple sub systems based on the responsiblity.
* A facade is a class that provides a simple interface to a complex subsystem which contains lots of moving parts. 
* Advantage is we can isolate our code from the complexity of a subsystem.
